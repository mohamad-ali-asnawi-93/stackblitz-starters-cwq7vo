# Instructions  

  Rather than hard coding strings, we can get user inputs. Run the code below and see what happens:

  ```javascript
  const name = prompt("What is your name? ");
  console.log(name);
  ```

  Run the code.

  ## What happened 

  1. It pops up a dialog box with the message `What is your name?`.
  2. Now, type `Haris` inside the dialog box and click `OK`.
  3. Console should output `Haris`, indicating that the string `'Haris'` is stored inside the variable `name`.
  Now we are able to see the variable value of `name`.
